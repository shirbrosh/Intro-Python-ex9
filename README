I discussed the exercise with: Gadi Fleischer, Daniel Shookroun.

=============================

=============================

This exercise contains 4 files:
car.py- A class that defined a Car object, a pawn from the game 'rush-hour', each car has
    a name, length, location on the game board and orientation.
board.py- A class that defined a Board object, a play board of the game 'rush-hour'. A
    board object contains the actual board- a list of lists, each list represent a
    row in the game board, and a car dictionary that keeps all the Cars objects that
    participate in the specific game.
game.py- A class that defined a Game object, this Object runs the game 'rush-hour'.
    The game has a board which is a Board object and a car dictionary that keeps all
    the Cars objects that participate in the specific game.
helper.py - contains a load_json function.


==================
=  Description: =
==================
I added some auxiliary functions-
in board.py:
    1.__wanted_cor_row_and_col - A function that returns the cell location which must be empty
        for the car to move to the movekey direction- as a tuple, and also as integer that
        represents the row and column of the location.
    2.__in_range - A function that returns True if the given coordinate is in the board
        limits of False otherwise.
    3.__check_legal_move - A function that checks if a move is legal according to the game rules.
in game.py:
    1.__end_game - A function that determines if the player won the game- it checks if a car
        has reached the target location.
    2.__check_valid_input- A function that checks if the users input is valid according to the game
        requirements. It returns True if valid or False otherwise
in the main function:
    __read_jason- A function that receives a file name for a jason file, opens, and reads the
        file and if all the information given in the file is valid according to the
        game rules, the data is updated to the game.
